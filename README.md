# PalBorrow

If we have learned somehting in Blockchain, specially in critp is that you shouldn't trust, verify. 

Even when you are borrowing money to a friend, yu should verify if it's risky to do it, and thankfully, we have GHO data to discover it. 


## Description

With PalBorrow you can check if your friend is elegible to give them a borrow. Just type their wallet address and see if it would represent a high risk for you, taking in consideration their current and historical data in GHO stablecoin.
